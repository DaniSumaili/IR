92,Elisavet Dimitrokali,https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/elisavet-dimitrokali,"Research Interests: I am an Assistant Professor in the Design Futures within the Faculty of Arts and Humanities. I am trained in Interior Architecture and Design with a PhD (in 2015) in Environment Impact Evaluation of Building Materials and Energy Systems.
I have worked for several years in academia and in the industry from where I gained a multi-disciplinary background and experience working in a wide range of projects across different sectors. User experience design and interaction, co-design and prototyping, public perception and behavioural change have been at the core of my research but I have always been interested in bringing methods from engineering into design; for example, using 6-Sigma problem solving from engineering to predict failure of design development and execution as well as to measure perception on aesthetic appearance and conduct design experiments to understand how different factors influence design or perception. I have also found it fascinating to use technologies to understand deeper perception like eye-tracking or gauges to measure specific attributes like softness and hardness, gaps and colour harmony in design.
My current research focus is on co-design, user experience and prototyping of products and technologies with applications in healthcare and wellbeing, in energy, buildings, and in automotive. Drawing on my background in design, environmental management, and product engineering, I work at the interface between design and product engineering to develop innovative strategies and practices that drive high impact solutions in people's lives. Within my existing role, my research interests for independent research lie in the field of smart textiles innovation for health and wellbeing and how we can apply such solutions into autonomous vehicles.  I am also interested in advancing Perceived Quality research of design and engineering products, moving away from the typical methods used. Beyond that, I am interested to be engaged in exploring how to influence strategic research decisions, policy, manage risk, and how to motivate investment in experiential product engineering.
Prior to my current role, I worked in Geely Design Automotive (2019-2020) as Design Quality Specialist of the new Lotus SUV and I was responsible for conducting benchmarking activities, customer research, leading design language theme development, and leading reviews with different stakeholders on improving the interior design quality from dimensional 3D models and clay models. Before, I worked in Jaguar Land Rover (2017-2019) as Pat Leader Engineer on surface materials for the following programme vehicles, Vellar, I-Pace, Discovery, and XFL China. I led a small team of three that focused on conducting customer studies, in doing benchmarking and evaluating customer preferences, I led the eye-tracking research in my departments and trained colleagues on how to use it and how to conduct studies with the technology. I also supervised 5 MSc students from WMG who had projects from the PQ department to improve and bring new dimensions into perceived quality. I also worked in material innovation supporting the CMF team in the development of new bio-based materials. For that, I was organising large stakeholder meetings with experts from engineering to review process development on a weekly basis.
Before working in the automotive, I was a Research Fellow in WMG within Warwick University, at the Sustainable Materials Group, and at the Experiential Engineering Group. I led the following research projects: Technology Strategy Board KTP with First Utility on Public’s perception on smart thermostats, Technology Strategy Board with JSJS on smart energy monitoring of office buildings in the campus, various projects under the EPSRC PHEE (Participation in Healthcare Engineering) like the co-design and prototyping of an assistive technology called KIOSK, that was piloted in healthcare environments to collect feedback in a creative way from end-users about transforming interior environments like waiting areas. I also led the GRP Energy-funded project called PVTRee: Imagining a 3D Solar Future (solar trees) in co-deigning and prototyping solar trees. One of the models was chosen by WMG to be 3D printed on a large scale and to be placed as the central piece at the Festival for the Imagination at Warwick University (2015). From all the projects that I was involved in, I have published research papers in journals and peered reviewed conference proceedings. From the PVTree project, I received high publicity and prize awards for my creativity and co-ordination of the festival piece. I was mentioned in Guardian News and was shortlisted to talk about co-creation in TEDx Leamington Spa. The project reached other Science Festivals and was introduced into schools as well. Here is a link to how this project came together https://animoto.com/play/W8SRTbBb0BvOT0mjTLh0Zg?autostart=1.  Can you imagine a 3D Solar Future charging our electric vehicles? I am interested to bring to life this project and I am looking for opportunities. My post-doctoral research career started in 2012 at Oxford Brookes University in the Low Carbon Group. I led the ESRC/RCUK Evaloc (Evaluation of Low Carbon Communities), in collaboration with the Environmental Change Institute of the University of Oxford. I was responsible for the Household Level Research of the project that looked to measure, monitor, and map the impacts and effectiveness of the low-carbon interventions applied in the 6 low carbon communities, both in the short and long term, from a technical and occupants’ perspective.

108,Michelle Farrell,https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/michelle-farrell,"Research Interests: My main research interest is in human-environment relationships during the Holocene, particularly in landscapes that are today considered marginal for human settlement, and especially on islands. I am also interested in the application of pollen dispersal and deposition models and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation cover and cultural landscapes. I am currently working on four main projects.
 
1) Palaeoenvironments of the Maltese Islands
The ERC-funded FRAGSUS (fragility and sustainability in restricted island environments: adaptation, culture change and collapse in prehistory) project, led by Caroline Malone (Queen’s University Belfast), takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the Neolithic Temple Culture of the Maltese Islands. The Maltese Temple Culture flourished between c. 3600 and c. 2350 BC and is characterised by highly elaborate megalithic architecture and figurative artwork. It is currently unclear how these small, relatively isolated, resource-poor islands were able to support such a complex society for over a millennium. Existing palaeoenvironmental evidence indicates that early Holocene woodland began to be cleared before 5500 BC, and subsequent land-use during the Neolithic consisted of both crop cultivation and animal husbandry. Archaeological data suggest a possible ‘collapse’ occurring at around 2350 BC, but currently there is no clear explanation for this event. My role within the project is to contribute to the reconstruction of prehistoric environments in the Maltese Islands by undertaking palynological analysis of sediment cores retrieved from several locations. I am also researching modern pollen-vegetation relationships in Malta in order to understand potential taphonomic biases within the palynological data, and have carried out fieldwork in Sicily with the aim of obtaining estimates of relative pollen productivity which can be used to produce quantitative reconstructions of past vegetation cover and land-use in Malta.
 
2) Reconstruction of Neolithic cultural landscapes
The ERC-funded Times of Their Lives project, led by Alasdair Whittle (Cardiff University) and Alex Bayliss (Historic England), aims to construct more precise chronologies for the Neolithic period in Europe through the application of formal chronological modelling in a Bayesian statistical framework. My role within ToTL is to apply quantitative methods for reconstruction of landscape setting and land-cover dynamics to existing palynological data from the Somerset Levels and Orkney. Within this sub-project, extant pollen datasets have been collated, age-depth models refined, and the Multiple Scenario Approach to land-cover reconstruction is being undertaken in order to create maps of possible past vegetation mosaics in these important cultural landscapes for key time slices. Analysis of these reconstructions allows us to consider the extent to which activity within these landscapes might be expected to be detectable in existing pollen records, and provides a context for improved understanding of the cultural reshaping of these iconic landscapes during the Neolithic.
 
3) Estimates of relative pollen productivity
A key goal of palynologists since the earliest days of the discipline has been the quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation abundance. Empirical estimates of relative pollen productivity (RPP) extracted from measurements of modern pollen assemblages and vegetation cover are an essential pre-requisite for testing pollen dispersal and deposition models and applying PolLandCal approaches to vegetation reconstruction from pollen signals, such as the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm or the Multiple Scenario Approach. A fundamental assumption of most pollen analytical work, whether quantitative or qualitative, is that RPP can be treated as a constant for a given pollen morphotype regardless of climate or habitat. A wide range of values for single taxa have been reported from different studies, but since each study used a different methodology, it is not possible to determine whether the assumption is in error, or whether the different methods used have led to systematically different values. Research undertaken as part of the Crackles Bequest Project developed and applied a standardised methodology for obtaining estimates of RPP for common taxa in several different habitats at multiple locations in north-west Europe, allowing the assumption of constant RPP to be tested.
 
4) Orcadian palaeoenvironments
My PhD research utilised pollen analysis and a suite of allied techniques to explore concepts of marginality and anthropogenic responses to changing environmental conditions in prehistoric Orkney. Since completing my Ph.D. I have maintained my interest in Orcadian palaeoenvironments and am currently collaborating on the “Bay of Ireland Palaeolandscape Assessment”, funded by the Carnegie Trust and led by Scott Timpany (University of the Highlands and Islands, Orkney College). This project takes a holistic approach to the investigation of landscape change in Orkney over a period of approximately 7000 years, from the Mesolithic to the Bronze Age, by analysing a section of landscape which incorporates the dryland, intertidal and marine zones. The interdisciplinary approach will provide data on changing sea-levels, climate and landscape, and information relating to sustainability and resilience of prehistoric communities in their interactions with the changing landscape will add significant depth to our understanding of prehistoric Orkney. It is hoped that the results will also be applicable to sites elsewhere in the UK and northern Europe.",Michelle Farrell,"School of Energy, Construction and Environment","Faculty of Engineering, Environment & Computing"

My research is interested in the transformative potential of agroecological processes in fragile environments and, more particularly, in the social-ecological processes and relationships through which communities of practice may be more able to mobilise and shape change on their own terms to reduce attendant vulnerabilities. This has included the potential of agroecology to address forms of violence by supporting social farming and deliberative democratic processes framed around the co-management of resources. It has explored the extent to which small ‘non-movements’ employ non-threatening, practice-based co-generative processes not only to shape physical landscapes, but to negotiate social change by re-forging networks based on principles of reciprocity and trust. My research interests also involve understanding how participatory praxis helps us to link the socio-cultural, ecological and political dimensions, and acts as a bridge between peace formation, disaster risk reduction and/or climate change adaptation on one hand, and equitable resilience and epistemic and cognitive justice on the other.

267,Riya Patel,https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/riya-patel,"Research Interests: I have two key areas of interest in terms of my reserach. The first is the role of religion in health and well-being. Religion has often been perceived as the 'black box' that should be ignored and not explored in health and healthcare research, yet there is a growing evidence base that highlights religion can have both a positive and negative influence on health outcomes. I am keen to investigate the mechanisms and functions that underpin religiously integrated health interventions, which led me to my current research project the RHIBS Taxonomy. 
Closely related to this, religious beliefs and practices are often intertwined with cultural beliefs and practices. To have a truly holistic understanding of health, illness and associated behaviours we need to better understand this link. I am interested in how we can better understand the influence of cultural beliefs and practices around health and well-being within BME communities through working with Faith-based organisations. If we can develop this understand we can work collaboratively with individuals belonging to these communities to begin reducing the barriers that exist with intentions to reduce health inequalities that affect the BME communities.

279,"Stephen John Powley, MIET",https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/stephen-john-powley,"Research Interests: The goal of my research is to demonstrate how rigorous modelling of business and engineering practices can contribute to improving the resilience of complex, software-intensive systems. Much of my work is widely applicable, but I focus on the practices needed to keep connected vehicles secure throughout their lifecycle. I apply ontology engineering and model-based systems engineering (MBSE) methods to enterprise systems of systems comprising people, processes and technology. The outputs of my research describe novel conceptual modelling techniques and show how they can be used to give enterprises the capabilities they need to engineer secure vehicle systems.
Human society is increasingly reliant on complex, networked systems, but our ability to comprehend and describe them is failing to keep pace with the technology. The result is increasingly chaotic, ad hoc systems of systems that can behave in unexpected ways. For example, most new vehicles have safety-critical components connected directly to the Internet, which increases complexity and creates new paths for hackers. Connected vehicles have great potential to create new mobility opportunities, reduce accidents, and reduce pollution. In operation, they form part of a massively complex, ever-changing system of systems that is vulnerable to cyber-attacks. A remote attacker could steal a truck, crash a car or even bring a city to a standstill. Vulnerabilities can be exploited from the concept phase through to end-of-life, meaning rigorous engineering and business practices are required to keep data private and people safe.
To operate securely, and therefore safely, connected vehicle systems must be developed, operated, maintained and retired using advanced methods that address this shifting complexity. Yet in 2019, the US non-profit organisation Consumer Watchdog reported that automotive companies are deceiving the public about cybersecurity risks and their inability to eliminate them. Moving beyond this is a massive challenge in an environment characterised by rapid innovation, conflicting needs, complex supply chains, and emerging legislative frameworks. Enterprises must evolve to develop and maintain the capabilities needed to manufacture and operate secure connected vehicles.
Much of my work addresses the challenges of modelling complex socio-technical systems at a more abstract level. This is important because new MBSE techniques are needed to better address complexity, where the relationships between cause and effect are unknown. Careful modelling that accounts for different contexts and ways of seeing the world can help to reveal hidden issues well before they would otherwise be identified.
I focus on how organisations can collaborate as enterprises to create the conditions needed to ensure that vehicles are acceptably secure. This means exploring both how ‘acceptable security’ is defined and how we can prove it has been achieved. To do this, I am developing an ontologically well-founded conceptual framework to underpin integrated models of needs and evaluations. Building models using this framework not only leads directly to better security outcomes, but also generates business intelligence and auditing information. This is valuable to automotive companies, who must have reasonable and justifiable confidence in the security of their products. They may also be called upon to provide evidence of due diligence to stakeholders such as investors, insurers, regulators and courts.",,,

296,Chitta Saha,https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/persons/chitta-saha,"Research Interests:  My current research is involved in energy harvesting and its application areas, renewable energy, Thermo-acoustic technology and measurement and sensor technology. My Ph.D was on modelling and optimisation of an electromagnetic vibrational energy harvester and its electronic areas for wireless sensor applications funded by the EU Framework 6 project VIBES (http://www.vibes.ecs.soton.ac.uk/). During my PhD study, I developed the model of an electromagnetic (EM) vibrational generator and verified the model with the measured and simulated results. Also I successfully applied the model to optimise the device for machine monitoring applications (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6272752.stm) and built the suitable voltage converter circuit for EM energy harvester device. I had been a research associate/fellow on a £2m multi-university EPSRC funded SCORE project (www.score.uk.com) at the University of Nottingham for four and half years. The concept of SCORE Stove is to generate electricity from a cooking stove using a well-known thermo- acoustic principle. During my time on the SCORE project, I was responsible for the design of the SCORE alternator and evaluating the SCORE engine performance, also assisting the exploitation of the SCORE research results in UK and aboard. During 2013-2015, I was successful in obtaining a £136,000 TSB funded energy harvesting (REGAH-E10305) research project collaboration with Piezotag ((www.piezotag.com) and Severn Trent (www.stwater.co.uk) for two years. I was working as a co-investigator/academic leader on the energy harvesting project. The idea of the project is the delivery of working prototype Power Harvesting & Power management system capable of powering Severn Trent Water’s remote water pressure and flow rate sensor & data loggers at a lower overall cost than the battery powered. A test rig has been set up in John Laing building and this project will develop Coventry University’s relationship with a large locally based business leading to links that could generate far more academically important projects well into future. The project was successfully delivered – work is currently ongoing. ",Chitta Saha,"School of Computing, Electronics and Maths","Faculty of Engineering, Environment & Computing"

It also includes developing technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the flue gases of power plants and chimneys, as well as burn the fuels in pure oxygen (Oxy-fuel), which results in a flue gas that consists entirely of carbon dioxide and water vapours that can be captured relatively easily and can be stored safely in repositories deep underground. Moreover, Dr. Sher is working towards sustainable energy, environment, climate change and low carbon technologies. His main interests are in the conversion of renewable sources such as biomass, solar, wind and hydro into heat and power including their impact on the environment and climate change. Dr. Sher is also studying the combustion behaviour of different fossil fuels to get a better understanding of their environmental impacts. His expertises are in energy, heat and mass transfer operations, fluid mixing, distillation, energy optimisation, wastewater treatment, hydrogen production, fluidised bed combustion (FBC), life cycle assessment (LCA), oxy-fuel combustion, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling.

Photography – portraiture, authorship, process: Here I explore creative decision-making, tacit knowledge and authorship in photography practice and reception. This has developed into twin projects – one looking at the masculinization of humanist photography, and another exploring our relationship to the photographic portrait before and after digital through the philosophy of Kant and Levinas.
Creativity in cinema production: After developing an undergraduate short course on cinema design, I began to explore creative decision-making in the film industry. This research focused on production design and design-led approaches to creative industry studies, which was funded by the AHRC to conduct a project – ‘Form Follows Fiction’ – on design decisions in 1930s Hollywood, specifically the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical series.
I am also interested in research collaborations on the following topics: mobility and the flâneur; Christmas and popular culture; ethics in art and design practice. I would welcome enquiries seeking to work together in any of the above areas.
