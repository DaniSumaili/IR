My research in marketing strategy and consumer behaviour is underpinned by an interest in data.  I’m interested in how data can be used to change consumer and citizen behaviour, particularly in areas that can improve well-being. E.g. how can data help different stakeholders to work together to tackle bigger issues facing society, such as security, sustainability, and health? My research also examines how organisations capture and use data to achieve their objectives. E.g. what impact have Big Data and digitalisation had on how organisations make strategic decisions?  Recently my research has examined the privacy issues that exist between those producing data and those who consume it, examining the circumstances in which consumers are prepared to share their data and what benefits they expect in return."

Multi-criteria optimization methods will be developed to handle three aspects of sustainability simultaneously including social, economic and environmental aspects.
Plan to do novel research in the cutting edge of combinations of data analytics and operational research. This research will involve development of

fuzzy evolving systems for modelling dynamic systems whose structure and parameters are changing over time using dynamically received data;

rule based fuzzy causal maps for modelling uncertain knowledge of causal relations among entities using fuzzy sets and type-2 fuzzy sets.

I'm particularly interested in better understanding the relationships between migration and inequality in the context of the Global South and currently lead the UKRI GCRF South-South Migration, Inequality and Development Hub (MIDEQ). The Hub works with academics, practitioners and international organisations in 12 countries to decentre the production of knowledge about migration and its consequences away from the Global North towards those countries where most migration takes place, in turn building the capacity of Global South scholars to build an evidence base and shape the issues that directly affect them.

My Ph.D was on modelling and optimisation of an electromagnetic vibrational energy harvester and its electronic areas for wireless sensor applications funded by the EU Framework 6 project VIBES (http://www.vibes.ecs.soton.ac.uk/). During my PhD study, I developed the model of an electromagnetic (EM) vibrational generator and verified the model with the measured and simulated results. Also I successfully applied the model to optimise the device for machine monitoring applications (http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6272752.stm) and built the suitable voltage converter circuit for EM energy harvester device. I had been a research associate/fellow on a £2m multi-university EPSRC funded SCORE project (www.score.uk.com) at the University of Nottingham for four and half years. The concept of SCORE Stove is to generate electricity from a cooking stove using a well-known thermo- acoustic principle. During my time on the SCORE project, I was responsible for the design of the SCORE alternator and evaluating the SCORE engine performance, also assisting the exploitation of the SCORE research results in UK and aboard. During 2013-2015, I was successful in obtaining a £136,000 TSB funded energy harvesting (REGAH-E10305) research project collaboration with Piezotag ((www.piezotag.com) and Severn Trent (www.stwater.co.uk) for two years. I was working as a co-investigator/academic leader on the energy harvesting project. The idea of the project is the delivery of working prototype Power Harvesting & Power management system capable of powering Severn Trent Water’s remote water pressure and flow rate sensor & data loggers at a lower overall cost than the battery powered. A test rig has been set up in John Laing building and this project will develop Coventry University’s relationship with a large locally based business leading to links that could generate far more academically important projects well into future. The project was successfully delivered – work is currently ongoing. "

His research interests lie in political ecology, food regimes, agrarian change and agroecology, agri-environmental politics and governance, and the international political economy of agri-food systems. Mark is also a qualified ecologist with a particular interest in landscape and historical ecology. He has taken a lead role in a significant number of research projects, including a Leverhulme Trust project addressing Agricultural Multifunctionality in the WTO (a multi-country study exploring the relationship between neoliberalism and agricultural sustainability), DEFRA/CEH/FERA/NERC AgriLand, Natural England (EU Agri-Environmental Policy), Carnegie Trust UK (Asset-based Rural Development), UK Food Group (Mapping UK Government Thinking on Globalisation). Mark has published journal articles, book chapters, and monographs addressing sustainable agriculture, political economy and the governance of food systems, political ecology, and agri-environmental policy. His research currently focuses on the political ecology of neoliberalism in the agri-food and environment sectors, changes in agri-food and environmental governance, and on the study of interest groups and social movements proposing/opposing these trends, and on nature-society relations more broadly. These concerns focus around ‘post-development’ theory in which there is a foregrounding of ecological sustainability and social equity issues, with particular reference to agroecology and food sovereignty. Mark has undertaken research in Europe, Australia, North America, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region. He has most recently been working on constructions of neoliberal hegemony in Australian agri-environmental governance.

Project 1: Reverse logistics for the recovery of aluminium in the construction industry. This project investigates the reverse logistics process of aluminium that allows the construction industry to become fashionable and, at the same time, resource-efficient. The work will develop an understanding of the new industrial processes and business models enabling the recovery of increasingly complex aluminium-based building products, e.g. façades, windows and building frames, into other products, components or materials whose values have been retained throughout their life-cycle.
Project 2: Towards the new circular bio-plastics economy. This project aims to answer a seemingly simple yet important research question: what are the impacts of bio-plastics to the environment, businesses and society? The answers will transform the way in which plastics are consumed in daily life, provide a strong underpinning to the future development of sustainable bio-plastics, and ultimately address both the upstream (sourcing) and downstream (consumption/end-of-life) supply chain concerns.
Project 3: ""Cash your trash”: a Reverse Logistics Network Design for Circular Supply Chain. This research concerns the design of a reverse logistics network of supply chains based on Circular Economy. The work involves the development of mathematical models combined with an investigation into practice to test the potential solutions in terms of economics and environmental impacts.
Project 4: Towards Healthcare 4.0: Cyber-Physical Systems in Healthcare. This research investigates the roles of Industry 4.0 technologies and identifies their impacts on the next generation healthcare operations and supply chain. It is expected that the adoption of these technologies will improve not only the quality of health operations but also patients safety."

No longer are computers necessarily unwieldy devices tied to their desk, tethered by power cords and network cabling. Nor are we anymore wedded to the mouse and keyboard for their user interface. The rise in ability and popularity of small mobile, wirelessly connected devices has changed for ever what we thought was possible.
Despite these advances, distributed sensing is only feasible for a limited set of applications and inferring knowledge from these sensors is a problem that we do not yet hold the complete solution to.
I want my research to form part of the solution – to enable inexpensive, reliable, long-lived wireless sensing that provide not just data, but meaningful and reliable high-level information”."

Conceived as tomorrow’s Smart Dust two decades ago, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are now recognised as one of this century’s most exciting, potentially pervasive technologies: they can enhance the way we interact with environments, buildings and machines. My work is towards enabling WSNs’ real-world usage and extending their applicability away from simple data generators towards intelligent data consumers, knowledge generators and autonomous decision-makers. In particular, my research addresses the issues of WSN systems’ longevity, robustness, information usage and usability in the context of several sensing and actuation applications: i) human safety enhancement through physiological sensing and risk prediction; ii) buildings monitoring and occupant empowerment; iii) distributed energy systems and mini-grids."

Kristin Aune joined Coventry University in 2014, having taught on sociology and youth work and theology programmes at the University of Westminster, Ridley Hall Cambridge and the University of Derby. At Derby she became Reader in Sociology and Director of the Centre for Society, Religion and Belief. She has been a visiting fellow at Grinnell College, Iowa, and Uppsala University. She leads the Centre’s Faith and Peaceful Relations research group.
She has undertaken pioneering work on gender, religion and feminism. Her book on single women’s marginalisation in the church led to a PhD on gender in evangelical Christianity, the findings of which were widely published. Fascinated by how women’s changing lives are affecting their faith commitments, she co-edited Women and Religion in the West: Challenging Secularization, which traces the disaffiliation of women from religious institutions, exploring differences between Christianity, Islam and alternative spirituality. Her book with Catherine Redfern, Reclaiming the F Word, was a ground-breaking study of the resurgence of feminism in Britain and attracted major public attention. Several articles about feminists’ approaches to religion and spirituality emerged. In 2015 she ran, with colleagues at Uppsala and Coimbra universities, the ‘Is secularism bad for women?’ workshops, from which a special issue of the journal Social Compass appeared in 2017. She was the Principal Investigator on the 2016-18 project 'Domestic Abuse in UK Churches: A Case Study of Cumbria' (with Dr Rebecca Barnes at the University of Leicester and Mandy Marshall, Director of the charity Restored). 
Religion and higher education is her other research area. Her latest book on this is 'Religion and Higher Education in Europe and North America' (ed., with Jacqueline Stevenson, Routledge 2017). From 2009-2012 she was Co-Investigator on 'Christianity and the University Experience in Contemporary England', a three-year AHRC and ESRC project with Durham and Chester universities exploring Christian students’ experiences of university and how faith shapes, and is shaped by, university life. From 2016-18 she is co-directing, with Revd Dr Jeremy Law at Canterbury Christ Church and Dr Mathew Guest at Durham, the project Chaplains on Campus, exploring university chaplaincy in UK universities. She is also Principal Investigator on the project 'Tackling religion-based hate crime on the muliti-faith campus' (funder: Office for Students, 2018-2020) and Co-Investigator on a study of religious student societies (led by the think tank Theos).

Helen has numerous journal publications including two books: ‘Ugandan Women War Survivors’ (Liebling-Kalifani, 2009) and ‘Justice and Health Provision for Survivors of Sexual Violence’ (Liebling and Baker, 2010). Helen’s research includes several innovations in theory including a re-conceptualisation of trauma, integrated justice and health approaches, and a holistic approach for service provision for conflict-affected survivors, the arguments for entitlement to health care being a human rights issue and policies for war survivors as well as governance and sexual violence. Helen has carried out consultancies, training and interventions in Africa to enhance support for conflict survivors and service providers in conjunction with Isis-WICCE, Uganda. Consequently Helen has had her policy recommendations adopted by the pre-consultative meeting in gender mainstreaming in the African Union and the executive summary and published book were presented to the President of Uganda who stated he would act on their recommendations. Furthermore, the South African Correctional Department recommended implementation of Helen’s research and policy recommendations to inform services for conflict survivors at trauma centres opened in Gulu and Kitgum, northern Uganda.

Area of Expertise:

Applied research with survivors of conflict and post-conflict sexual violence and torture in Africa since 1998. Helen has carried out consultancies, training and interventions to enhance support for conflict survivors and service providers. Helen has also carried out research with survivors of Sexual and Gender-Based Violence and torture including refugees and asylum seekers in the United Kingdom."

Although originally a human geographer by training, her constant involvement since 2005, in inter- multi- and cross- disciplinary research practice, sees her identifying more closely these days with the broader field of (social) sustainability science.
Alex specialises in qualitative research techniques, with much of her work informed by a participatory action research approach to study design. She is experienced in researching community-based sustainable place making both within the UK and internationally. This includes, for example, on-going collaboration with colleagues from Colombia, Brazil, Canada, China and mainland Europe. For the period 2011-2015 she was also a co-editor of the international Journal of Environmental Policy and Planning (Taylor and Francis).
External funding sources supporting Alex's research to date have included the UK Economic and Social Research Council, Welsh Government, Canal and Rivers Trust, The Law Society (Wales), Sustrans and the Forestry Commission. She has also previously received funding to participate in international visiting research scholarships in Finland (Ruralia, University of Helsinki) and Hungary (Hungary Academy of Sciences, Budapest). Most recently, as coordinator (together with partner institutions from five other European countries), Alex has been successful in securing funding for a Marie Skłodowska-Curie–Innovative Training Network, entitled ‘RECOMS’ (2018-2022). Funded by the European Commission, the purpose of RECOMS is to train 15 Early Stage Research (ESR) Fellows in innovative, transdisciplinary and transformative approaches to promoting and facilitating resourceful and resilient community environmental practice.

It also includes developing technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the flue gases of power plants and chimneys, as well as burn the fuels in pure oxygen (Oxy-fuel), which results in a flue gas that consists entirely of carbon dioxide and water vapours that can be captured relatively easily and can be stored safely in repositories deep underground. Moreover, Dr. Sher is working towards sustainable energy, environment, climate change and low carbon technologies. His main interests are in the conversion of renewable sources such as biomass, solar, wind and hydro into heat and power including their impact on the environment and climate change. Dr. Sher is also studying the combustion behaviour of different fossil fuels to get a better understanding of their environmental impacts. His expertises are in energy, heat and mass transfer operations, fluid mixing, distillation, energy optimisation, wastewater treatment, hydrogen production, fluidised bed combustion (FBC), life cycle assessment (LCA), oxy-fuel combustion, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling.

I am also interested in the application of pollen dispersal and deposition models and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation cover and cultural landscapes. I am currently working on four main projects.
 
1) Palaeoenvironments of the Maltese Islands
The ERC-funded FRAGSUS (fragility and sustainability in restricted island environments: adaptation, culture change and collapse in prehistory) project, led by Caroline Malone (Queen’s University Belfast), takes an interdisciplinary approach to the study of the Neolithic Temple Culture of the Maltese Islands. The Maltese Temple Culture flourished between c. 3600 and c. 2350 BC and is characterised by highly elaborate megalithic architecture and figurative artwork. It is currently unclear how these small, relatively isolated, resource-poor islands were able to support such a complex society for over a millennium. Existing palaeoenvironmental evidence indicates that early Holocene woodland began to be cleared before 5500 BC, and subsequent land-use during the Neolithic consisted of both crop cultivation and animal husbandry. Archaeological data suggest a possible ‘collapse’ occurring at around 2350 BC, but currently there is no clear explanation for this event. My role within the project is to contribute to the reconstruction of prehistoric environments in the Maltese Islands by undertaking palynological analysis of sediment cores retrieved from several locations. I am also researching modern pollen-vegetation relationships in Malta in order to understand potential taphonomic biases within the palynological data, and have carried out fieldwork in Sicily with the aim of obtaining estimates of relative pollen productivity which can be used to produce quantitative reconstructions of past vegetation cover and land-use in Malta.
 
2) Reconstruction of Neolithic cultural landscapes
The ERC-funded Times of Their Lives project, led by Alasdair Whittle (Cardiff University) and Alex Bayliss (Historic England), aims to construct more precise chronologies for the Neolithic period in Europe through the application of formal chronological modelling in a Bayesian statistical framework. My role within ToTL is to apply quantitative methods for reconstruction of landscape setting and land-cover dynamics to existing palynological data from the Somerset Levels and Orkney. Within this sub-project, extant pollen datasets have been collated, age-depth models refined, and the Multiple Scenario Approach to land-cover reconstruction is being undertaken in order to create maps of possible past vegetation mosaics in these important cultural landscapes for key time slices. Analysis of these reconstructions allows us to consider the extent to which activity within these landscapes might be expected to be detectable in existing pollen records, and provides a context for improved understanding of the cultural reshaping of these iconic landscapes during the Neolithic.
 
3) Estimates of relative pollen productivity
A key goal of palynologists since the earliest days of the discipline has been the quantitative reconstruction of past vegetation abundance. Empirical estimates of relative pollen productivity (RPP) extracted from measurements of modern pollen assemblages and vegetation cover are an essential pre-requisite for testing pollen dispersal and deposition models and applying PolLandCal approaches to vegetation reconstruction from pollen signals, such as the Landscape Reconstruction Algorithm or the Multiple Scenario Approach. A fundamental assumption of most pollen analytical work, whether quantitative or qualitative, is that RPP can be treated as a constant for a given pollen morphotype regardless of climate or habitat. A wide range of values for single taxa have been reported from different studies, but since each study used a different methodology, it is not possible to determine whether the assumption is in error, or whether the different methods used have led to systematically different values. Research undertaken as part of the Crackles Bequest Project developed and applied a standardised methodology for obtaining estimates of RPP for common taxa in several different habitats at multiple locations in north-west Europe, allowing the assumption of constant RPP to be tested.
 
4) Orcadian palaeoenvironments
My PhD research utilised pollen analysis and a suite of allied techniques to explore concepts of marginality and anthropogenic responses to changing environmental conditions in prehistoric Orkney. Since completing my Ph.D. I have maintained my interest in Orcadian palaeoenvironments and am currently collaborating on the “Bay of Ireland Palaeolandscape Assessment”, funded by the Carnegie Trust and led by Scott Timpany (University of the Highlands and Islands, Orkney College). This project takes a holistic approach to the investigation of landscape change in Orkney over a period of approximately 7000 years, from the Mesolithic to the Bronze Age, by analysing a section of landscape which incorporates the dryland, intertidal and marine zones. The interdisciplinary approach will provide data on changing sea-levels, climate and landscape, and information relating to sustainability and resilience of prehistoric communities in their interactions with the changing landscape will add significant depth to our understanding of prehistoric Orkney. It is hoped that the results will also be applicable to sites elsewhere in the UK and northern Europe."

David is also founding academic programme director for Coventry University’s Professional Doctorate (DBA), and sits on the Management Group of the University’s Future Transport and Cities (FTC) Research Centre.
Since completion of his PhD in 2002, David has held a series of full-time professional research posts in both commercial consultancy and higher education settings. Over the past decade, these roles have incorporated significant academic leadership including:
Business plan development, implementation and monitoring: for specific ‘clusters’ within University Centres and, ultimately, for whole University research groups. This has included responding strategically to significant external shocks, such as the impact of the 2008 financial crisis, in order to safeguard research income generation and ensure research Centre sustainability.
Building and leading teams of academics: planning, securing and recruiting to new posts in line with an overall development strategy designed to support delivery of research centre business plan targets.
Leading teams of academic researchers: pastoral and performance management of staff across a range of grades from Research Assistant to Professor; and supporting career aspirations through day-to-day support, advice and guidance, team based development activities, and more formal individual mentoring.
Financial planning and management: budget forecasting and accounting of Research Centre spend and income.
Alongside these leadership capabilities, throughout his career to date, David has secured, managed and delivered more than 70 funded research or evaluation projects for clients across the public, private and charitable sectors. In the course of doing so he has gained extensive direct experience of utilising both quantitative and qualitative research methods. Particular strengths lie in the following areas:
Leading the design and implementation of research and evaluation frameworks.
Managing the use of electronic survey tools and analytical software to provide quantitative and qualitative information that is current, accurate and robust.
Quantitative economic impact modelling and mapping of labour market intelligence, employment and population data.
Triangulation of quantitative data and qualitative evidence through stakeholder and beneficiary engagement.

I am an interdiscplinary researcher studying interactions between the living world and the physical environment in freshwater ecosystems.  My work involves the application of concepts and methods from biology, ecology, hydrology, hydraulic engineering and geomorphology.  Much progress has been made in this interdisciplinary field, known as 'hydroecology', in recent years but there is much work still to do in sharing knowledge and better integrating the often disparate approaches from these disciplines.  This is extremely important in river ecosystems where biophysical linkages are especially strong.  My vision is to help the freshwater-related research community to make the best use of existing knowledge, identify information gaps and fill those gaps with original research that is truly interdisciplinary.

I believe that humanity faces two fundamental challenges over the next century: tackling climate change and supplying the demands imposed by the urbanisation of the developing world. Providing good quality housing for urban dwellers with minimal carbon emissions and at an affordable economic cost is what I strive towards. Natural materials such as timber and bamboo that combine great strength with minimal environmental impact (when sustainably grown and harvested) must be a fundamental part of the solution. My role as a structural engineer, is to enable and promote their use in a safe and reliable manner.

Without trust, conducting business would become cumbersome; friendships and family relations would break down; we would be unable to give ourselves into the hands of hospitals, or of the engineers who construct our cars and service the planes we fly in, and we would be suspicious of the water flowing from our taps. In short, societies fundamentally rely on trust.
Having researched trust for over a decade, my fascination with it is still growing. Lately, my work has increasingly taken an international focus, with projects in Eastern Europe, Cuba and Mongolia, among others. Informing this is an interest particularly in how people build – and lose – trust in others, and in important institutions, during significant social and economic transitions. The more unsettled we are, the more we need to rely on trust in order to organise our lives, but the more precarious and fragile it is likely to become."

Jesper Christensen started his “mechanical engineering” activities as an engine fitter apprentice working on large marine propulsion systems; a 3 year degree. After completion he enrolled at University studying “Industrial Engineering”; and was awarded a BSc in 2007. Following this he completed his MSc in “Design of Mechanical Systems” in 2010. During his studies he undertook several industrial based projects focused on optimisation; e.g. the development of an antivibration mount to improve fatigue life for a 250kg sewage pump in collaboration with Grundfoss. Before completing his MSc he also undertook a 4 month placement at Jaguar Land Rover focusing on FE correlation of foam material models for automotive seating.
Since joining Coventry University Jesper’s work has primarily focused on the development and implementation of optimisation algorithms for lightweighting applications, and has led to several invited presentations; for example to the German Association for Computational Mechanics, Dresden, 2012 and at in the House of Commons at the Set For Britain event in 2013. He was awarded his PhD on the topic of “Topology Optimisation of Structures Exposed to Large (non-linear) Deformations” in September 2015. Jesper is an active member of the IMeche and the STEM network.

By combining experimental, population, longitudinal and intervention approaches, my research has high scientific rigor with real world implications.
 
In my experimental work I examine the nature of linguistic and cognitive processes during literacy tasks using a range of methodologies, such as studying the time-course of spelling (spatio-dynamics of handwriting) and reading (eye-movement recording). Through population and longitudinal research, I consider the impact of different strengths, weaknesses and environmental influences on attainment more broadly. My research also includes examining the effectiveness of literacy interventions through large scale randomised controlled trials, and working closely with policy makers and educators to apply research findings to the classroom. For example, I led the Education Endowment Foundation Evidence Review on Literacy Development (2019), and am currently leading a Review of Measures of Attainment in Literacy, Mathematics and Science."

Iain MacKinnon’s interest in the cultural practices and belief systems of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland have led him to study and contribute to political discussion on the politics of land and knowledge in the area. In addition to his academic publications he has contributed to a range of media on aspects of the area’s history and culture – particularly in relation to land governance and indigenous knowledge.
He was co-author of a critical micro-study of crofting land tenure in the Highlands and Islands. This study helped to shape subsequent Scottish Government legislation on the topic. His previous work has also included project management, political advocacy, media relations, editing and helping to organise a study-tour on community development in the Hebrides for Government planners from the Papua Province, Indonesia.
A key aspect of current work being prepared for publication is an analysis of the Highlands and Islands as a site of historical colonisation. He believes that understanding the area’s longstanding and underlying imperial power relations and concomitant attitudes may be vital to properly understand and negotiate political contestation in the Highlands and Islands today.

Dr Hesamaldin Jadidbonab is a research fellow in Cyber security and Cyber-Physical Systems in Automotive and in particular in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). His research will be fucosed on design and develop of a multi-bus testbed demonstrator representing a full scale automotive functional structure to prove the testing results, as part of a funded project in support from Innovate UK, aimed at improving the safty and security of tomorrow's CAVs.    
Before, he has worked at the City University of London (CUL). During his PhD and post-doctoral study at City University of London (CUL) he has developed his in-depth knowledge on processes related to highly turbulent single and two-phase flows and practical skills essential for experimental fluid mechanics; e.g. Particle Image Velocimetry, Phase Doppler Anemometry, X-ray imaging, Shadowgraph and Schlieren imaging. His study is mainly focused on visualization and quantification of highly transient cavitating injector flows, flash boiling phenomena at the near nozzle region of a fuel spray, cavitation induced erosion and non-Newtonian flows in hydraulic devices. Throughout these projects, Hesam has demonstrated his abilities to design new experimental investigations, arrange required hydraulic and optical setups, design of replica models and install the necessary measuring and controlling instrumentation. During his appointment at CUL, he has collaborated closely with a number of researchers from academic and industrial partners, including Lubrizol Ltd. (UK), the University of Bergamo (UniBG, Italy) and Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU, Germany) and Argonne National laboratory (ANL). It is also worth mentioning that one of his key competencies is advanced image processing and computed-tomography reconstruction. 
He has received his bachelor’s in mechanical engineering from a joint program between Sharif University of Technology and Aachen University of Applied Science in 2008. In 2011, he graduated from Aachen University with a master in automotive powertrain and chassis engineering with a first class degree. Parallel to his studies he was enrolled as a research assistance in FEV GmbH from 2008 until the 2012. During this time, he has developed knowledge on modification of powertrain/engine dynamometer, emissions testing and after-treatment systems. In particular he has further broadened his knowledge of real driving emission and engine dynamometer testing by engaging in several ECU calibration of fuel injection timing in Diesel engines.

As a designer my background includes automotive styling, large scale structures, exhibition design, domestic furniture and products, infant care and diagnostic-technology products. An increasing interest into user focussed objects and experiences, led to the design of a moving experience-platform to share or individualise travel that was developed for my Masters Degree.
With 20 years of professional experience in the design industry and the most recent 10 years working specifically on healthcare projects, I have been directly involved with expert users, patient groups, and healthcare professionals. I have collaborated with a variety of SME’s and international companies tasked with production of subtle and meaningful solutions to often life-restricting, undignified experiences.
There are over 200 projects in the team portfolio during my time leading the design studio at HDTI (some listed below). Each design is based upon a defined user need. All solutions have a simple, de-stigmatised aesthetic. Each design aims to encourage product selection and promote continued usage:

After graduating with a BA degree in French and German, I spent a year in Greece teaching English and then returned to the UK to train as a language teacher. In 1993 I was appointed Lecturer in German at the University of Wolverhampton where I remained for 9 years, teaching German language, German studies, general linguistics and translation studies. I completed a PhD in Germanic linguistics at the University of Reading in 2007 and have since worked at Coventry University mainly teaching academic English and English linguistics. I have also given language teacher training and presently manage the University’s German language provision.
 
Research:
 
My main research interest is in grammatical theory and description, with a particular interest in ‘non-derivational’ or ‘constraint-based’ approaches such as Construction Grammar, though I remain convinced that an adequate theory of grammar is not ‘usage-based’ but one that takes grammar to be a form of acquired mental knowledge which remains throughout life relatively unaffected by the pressures of usage. I am presently working on an article investigating the relationship between ‘idiomatic’ and ‘non-idiomatic’ forms of ditransitive verbs in English.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a three-step technology which refers to carbon capture at the source of combustion or chemical reaction, its transportation, and subsequent long term storage in geological formations such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs and deep saline aquifers. Various trapping mechanisms are involved in the CO2 storage process (i.e. structural and stratigraphical, residual, dissolution and mineral trapping mechanism). These possible geological formations are distributed in different sedimentary basins around the world are deposited in a variety of depositional environment.

Stakeholders have also been demanding sustainable organisational strategies, products and services. Therefore, the role that sustainability plays in organisations and how they are incorporating sustainability into their strategies assumes vital importance. Since marketing plays an important role in how companies communicate with their customers and stakeholders, it could be argued that sustainability marketing must receive a special focus on executives. Above all, if not properly marketed, companies that have been integrating sustainability into their strategies may not be considered as sustainable organisations and therefore, may lose market value.
This study aims to assess the actual situation in terms of sustainability awareness of the marketers and sustainability professionals. Through mixed-method research, it investigates the drivers and barriers to sustainability marketing strategies and the marketing mix being implemented on those strategies. Questionnaires and interviews were conducted with top-executives on marketing and sustainability, and a quantitative analysis complemented by a qualitative one was employed.
The research’s findings indicate that brand reputation and customer satisfaction seems to be the main drivers for pursuing a sustainability marketing strategy. Likewise, stakeholder's commitment was indicated as an important driver. Main barriers encompass the pressure for short-term profits and the difficulty to measure sustainability results. Moreover, a comprehensive sustainability marketing mix focused mainly on Promotion, Product and Place are being implemented by marketers.
Findings from this research have implications for the marketing practitioners and academics, on the drivers and barriers to sustainability marketing mix implementation."

Through this research project I am surveying sculptural artworks produced by women in Britain between 1977 and 1990. With a particular focus on unusual sculptural materials, the processes of making and ephemeral artworks, I'll be exploring whether or not there exists a gendered aesthetic of making. I'll be further exploring any institutionalised gender-bias within the British art world and there will be a focus on group exhibitions of women's sculptural practice in Britain in this period."
